This repository is a creation I came up with after wondering how computers calculate square roots which are not perfect squares.
This would then lead to me creating this program, complete with a file containing the square root function and a main to execute
the program. It uses the Babylonian method (which can be found at this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTWxFGmWoZg) and has
extensive comments to help you understand what the program is doing! If you are looking to use this program please give credit in
the way of linking to this repository! Thank you!
